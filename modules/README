Hello!

This directory consists of two things:
 - Puppet modules (directories)
 - Dreamhack package modules (python files)

=== Puppet modules ===
These are ordinary puppet modules. Create a module here like this:
  svn cp template mymodule
  cat > mymodule.py <<EOF
  def generate(host, *args):
    return {'ipplan': None}
  EOF
  .. edit metadata.json and manifests/init.pp among others ..
  svn add mymodule mymodule.py
  svn commit -m 'new super awesome module!'
And the puppet master will automatically fetch this new module
and serve it!

=== Dreamhack package modules ===
These are Python scripts that are called when a puppet agent checks
in with the master. They are used to calculate what options, attributes
and requirements the different packages have.

Have a look at puppetboard.py for a nice example.

To test your module (please do this! ;)) run this:
./test mymodule server.tech.dreamhack.se
Run ./test without any arguments to see full usage

(Pay no attention to __init__.py, they are needed so that Python
understands that this is a library directory)
